# MMD - My Mobility Data ðŸš™
Welcome to the My Mobility Data (MMD) repository! This project is a personal initiative aimed at transforming a 20+ years old car into a state-of-the-art Software-Defined Vehicle (SDV) enhanced vehicle. The journey involves exploring and implementing various technologies to bring cutting-edge mobility solutions to a classic automobile.

## Goals
The primary goal of MMD is to retrofit an aging vehicle with autonomous driving capabilities. This ambitious project will leverage the latest advancements in AI, computer vision, and sensor technologies to create a safe and efficient self-driving experience.
- [ ] Start off with basics. Display current car data no more than 1s delay.
- [ ] Implement Computer Vision algorithms for real-time object detection.
- [ ] Integrate AI-driven decision-making systems to enhance vehicle autonomy.
- [ ] Incorporate sensor technologies such as LiDAR and radar for comprehensive environmental awareness.
- [ ] Develop a user-friendly interface for manual and autonomous driving modes.
